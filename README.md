# Hey there, Iâ€™m Hafiz Daud ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m fairly new to cybersecurityâ€”learning the ropes as a SOC/cybersecurity analyst and dreaming of a future in cloud security. I enjoy experimenting with new tools, whether itâ€™s setting up a Splunk SIEM lab on Ubuntu, writing Python scripts to parse logs, or exploring both Azure and GCP cloud fundamentals.

**Certifications Iâ€™m targeting in 2025:**  
- Cloud Digital Leader (Google) â€“ âœ“
- Blue Team Level 1 (SBTL) â€“ (In Progress)  
- CCNA  
- SC-900: Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals
- AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals

Coursera
- Google IT Support Professional Certificate (Coursera)
- Google Cloud Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (Coursera)
- Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Security Engineer

I genuinely enjoy defensive operations and have already built a Splunk Enterprise SIEM home labâ€”next on my list is creating a Google IAM environment. At the same time, Iâ€™m laying a solid foundation in Azure and GCP cloud fundamentals to support my long-term cloud security goals.

Feel free to explore my repositories for step-by-step guides, code snippets, and project notes. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a chat about cloud defenses and AI-driven security. Letâ€™s learn and grow together!
