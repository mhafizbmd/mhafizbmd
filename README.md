# Hey there, Iâ€™m Hafiz Daud ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m fairly new to cybersecurityâ€”learning the ropes as a SOC/cybersecurity analyst and dreaming of a future in cloud security. I enjoy experimenting with new tools, whether itâ€™s setting up a Splunk SIEM lab on Ubuntu, writing Python scripts to parse logs, or exploring both Azure and GCP cloud fundamentals.

**Certifications Iâ€™m targeting in 2025:**  
- Google Cloud Digital Leader â€“ âœ“  
- AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals â€“ (Planned)  
- Security Blue Team Level 1 (BTL1) â€“ (In Progress)  
- SC-900: Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance and Identity Fundamentals â€“ (Planned)  
- AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals â€“ (Planned)  
- CCNA â€“ (Planned)  
- Google IT Support Professional Certificate (Coursera) â€“ (Planned)  
- Google Cloud Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (Coursera) â€“ (Planned)  
- Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Security Engineer (Coursera) â€“ (Planned)

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on blue team operations and aim to create home labs for SIEM (Splunk Enterprise) and Google IAM next. Iâ€™m also building a foundation in Azure and GCP cloud fundamentals to support my long-term cloud security goals.

Feel free to explore my repositories for step-by-step guides, code snippets, and project notes. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, or just a chat about cloud defenses and AI-driven security. Letâ€™s learn and grow together!
